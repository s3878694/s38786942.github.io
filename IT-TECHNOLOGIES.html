        <p class="u-align-justify u-large-text u-text u-text-default u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">There are many technologies and developments being made at the moment,
however, the two areas which is relevant about the project idea of our group is
AI and Machine Learning and Autonomous vehicle. AI and Machine Learning in this
case can help with scanning, reading symptoms of a patient and giving advice or
predicted what illness do they have. As for autonomous vehicles, in the near
future, I want to expand the project further by making autonomous ambulance so
that it can arrive through the nearest course and learn which way in which time
will the road be busy or not.</p>

      <div class="u-clearfix u-sheet u-sheet-1">
        <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">AI
and Machine Learning:</h3>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-large-text u-text u-text-default u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">There is no denying the fact that Ai,
Machine Learning and Deep Learning is not so new a topic of discussion. For the
last few years, in this area, there have been many breakthrough achievements
such as the Artificial Intelligence can know detect a pattern, or a similarity
and then base on those aspects, the machine itself can predict the possible
outcome. Take Siri for example, from many previous calls, text messages, or the
app that the user most likely to open on first pickup, Siri will save all the
activities and use the data to predict the outcome by showing an app suggestion
for the user, remind the user to phone someone or even suggest which app is
suitable for the user in Appstore. What is more, there are some few computers
that are running test about Machine Learning as well, they say that it is
possible that psychologists do not have to work anymore for in 3 to 5 years
later, a first official robopsychologists can do all the work, maybe better
than a human. It is possible that we can talk to those robot as if we are
talking to a normal human being for it can understand the problems in the human
live, moreover, it can predict many outcomes of how lives of a human would turn
out if they keep following the same path. In order to achieve this, the
processor must be faster and smoother for the robot to be able to respond and
communicate like a normal human being, the computer does not have to be faster
than a human brain but need to be able to be creative, to think of possible
outcomes and ideas so that it can suggest to other human.</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-large-text u-text u-text-default u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-3">There would be a lot of impact if this area
is developed even more. Nowadays, more and more people have Alexdra, an AI in a
form of a speaker which monitor the house, in a house. What is more, smarthome
is now available in many countries around the world, which means there are
voice or face recognition used as key to enter the house. Smarthome would
display the weather on the TV of the house, adjusting the room temperature
based on the temperature outdoor, however the user can adjust this manually,
moreover, the house would alert the user whether the is it time to do the
laundry and would also alert if the fridge is out of food or water. However,
this technology can be in some other areas such as in medical area, AI can
analyze the symptom and use this information to make precaution, make medical
advice, and predicted the illness or disease the patient is having. However,
this development will not replace many jobs and make redundant of jobs but
instead, help create many more jobs for this area and others as well. In
addition, “AI can improve the efficiencies of workplaces and can augment the
work human can do” (Bernard Marr). Many people won’t have to risk their lives
because with AI, combining with robotic, the robot can do most of the work by
human without endanger any human lives.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-large-text u-text u-text-default u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-4">As for in daily life, it would be more convenient for me to have this
technology because not only does it remind me to do all the tasks but also help
me with the tasks itself. There are also robots that are being developed just
for the elderly, it can communicate, walk and play so that it would keep the
elderly company and would not feel lonely when there is no home or around them.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Autonomous
vehicles:</h3>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-large-text u-text u-text-default u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">In the last two decades, many companies
such as Google and Apple are competing against each other in autonomous
vehicles. There has no progress so far in these two companies, however, Tesla
company has manufactured many prototypes autopilot car, although it is not
fully autonomous yet, it still needs a pilot or a driver to drive the car for
the safety concern, but it still can detect obstacle, detect light signal and
the AI in the vehicle can control the speed of it. The latest model of
autopilot car of Tesla can drive around a block, with a supervisor in the
driver seat, without any difficulties at all, and this prove that the AI and
the technology are being greatly developed. Visionary of the future would be
that every house would have an autopilot care, which means that there is no
need a driver, all it has to be done is to choose the destination and the vehicle
would automatically takes the user there in no time. In order to achieve that,
the central control is needed so that it could coordinate all the autonomous
vehicles in the city, and the AI and Machine Learning can learn which way is actually
quicker and less time consuming by learning which rout is faster and less
crowed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-large-text u-text u-text-default u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-3">There are many impacts when it comes to
autonomous vehicles. Fist of all is economic shift, 12 million fully autonomous vehicles and
18 million partially autonomous vehicles will be sold worldwide each year
in 2035 (OHIO University 2020). As a matter of fact, by that time, 25% of all
vehicles are autopilot. Jobs such as taxi driver are being replaced as the result
of a rising number of autonomous vehicles. Second, commuters can save a great
amount of time. Since there is no need for a driver, in the journey, many
people can use this time to do something more productive such as reading, learning,
doing their job, or simply having a relax time. As a matter of fact, many
researchers have shown that driving could cause stress, however, with
driverless vehicles, the people won’t have to worry about traffic jam or accidents
because the control centre would be coordinating all the autonomous vehicles
for all the people. Moreover, this could also help with alleviating traffic
jams and increasing the efficiency of traffic flows. The third impact is that
it is more safety to drive an autonomous mobile rather than a normal car. They
are expected to have less accidents. According to National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, there were roughly 35,092 people who were killed
in car accidents in 2015 in US roads. However, advanced driver assistance
systems in autonomous mobile can reduce accidents by almost 90%, which can
save many lives and $190 billion each year for health care cost (OHIO University
2020).</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-large-text u-text u-text-default u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-4">As for
daily, from my perspective, because I live far from the city central, it would
be very convenient for me to travel, it could save a lot of times and effort.
For instance, everyday I have to go to school and spend almost an hour every
day to go to school and another hour to go back home, now, with driverless vehicles,
not only can I do all the work while the car drive by itself, but also it would
know and choose what rout is closest and fastest to get to my home. Another
point worth mentioning is that many people says “Why won’t you hired yourself a
drivers”, it is because that the driver is a human too, he is not always there
to take you home or take you to school, the car is more consisting, it would be
on time no matter what, not to mention there are a lower chance that I get into
automobile accidents, because in this case, the machine is more accurate than a
human being.</p>
